## Overview
Infinite Tic Tac Toe elevates the traditional game by allowing an unlimited board grid and incorporating three different game modes:
**AI Mode:** Play against a computer-controlled robot that makes moves automatically.
**Local Multiplayer:** Challenge a friend on the same device.
**Online Multiplayer:** Connect to other players over the internet and interact using built-in chat functionality.

The user interface is built with a clean design using Tailwind CSS, with responsive buttons representing game mode selections and dynamic game board updates. Real-time interactions are managed via Socket.IO for online matches, and the server is built with Express to handle room creation, joining, and move propagation.

## Game Modes

### Single Player (AI)
**How It Works:** After selecting the ‚ÄúPlay vs Robot‚Äù option, you play against an AI that makes randomized moves on the board.
**Gameplay:** Each move is checked for wins, and if no win is detected, the AI responds after a short delay.
**Code Reference:** The logic for AI moves is implemented in the client‚Äôs main App component, which uses a random selection from available cells.

### Local Multiplayer (Same Device)
**How It Works:** Choose ‚ÄúPlay vs Friend (Same Device)‚Äù to start a game on one device.
**Gameplay:** Players take turns tapping on the board. The game alternates the playing symbol between X and O.
**Code Reference:** The mode switch and move handling are managed in the App component with local state updates.

### Online Multiplayer with Chat
**How It Works:** Select ‚ÄúPlay Online‚Äù to join or create an online room.
**Room Management:** 
  - Create a room with a randomly generated room code.
  - Join a room by entering a valid room code or opt for a random match.
**Chat Functionality:** There is an integrated chat panel that allows exchanging messages with your opponent during the game.
**Realtime Interaction:** Socket.IO is used to synchronize moves and chat messages between clients.
**Code Reference:** The server-side room and chat management is handled in the Socket.IO event handlers in the server‚Äôs `index.js`, while client-side components manage the UI for room code input and chat panels.

## Rules and Gameplay
**Winning Condition:** A win is determined by the standard Tic Tac Toe rules using several unique winning combinations (e.g., rows, columns, and diagonals).
**Mark Removal:** Once a player has more than three moves, the earliest mark is removed to keep the game ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù and unpredictable.
**Turn-Based Play:** In online mode, each player‚Äôs turn is enforced by real-time updates. In single player mode, the player always goes first.
**Notifications:** The game displays notifications for events such as room creation, opponent joining, and game status during play.
